  Give me your repetitive, your ambiguously-named,
  Your !important declarations yearning to breathe free,
  The wretched refuse of your teeming stylesheets.

  This is a holding file for hacks / experiments. Its contents will be appended
  to application.css, overriding everything that comes before it.  Using this 
  file helps us keep the global styles clean and maintainable. Do your 
  colleagues (and future self) a favor by throughly documenting each selector.
