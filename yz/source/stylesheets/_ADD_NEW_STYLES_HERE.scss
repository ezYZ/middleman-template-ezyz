// This is a holding file for CSS that has yet to be integrated into the global
// style library. Its contents will be appended to application.css, overriding
// everything that comes before it.

// Using this file helps us quarantine sloppy code away from clean code. Do 
// your colleagues (and future self) a favor and throughly document the intent 
// behind each addition to this file. This will help a crazy, OCD frontend
// developer integrate your changes with global styles in the near future.
